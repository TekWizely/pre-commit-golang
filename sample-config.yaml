    # Golang Pre-Commit Hooks | https://github.com/tekwizely/pre-commit-golang
    #
    # Visit the project home page to learn more about the available Hooks,
    # including useful arguments you might want to pass into them.
    #
    # Staged Files:
    #   Unless configured to "always_run" (see below), hooks ONLY run when
    #   maching file types (usually *.go) are staged.
    #
    # File-Based Hooks:
    #   By default, hooks run against matching staged files individually.
    #   Currently, file-based hooks DO NOT accept user-args.
    #
    # Repo-Based Hooks:
    #   Hooks named '*-repo-*' only run once (if any matching files are staged).
    #   They are NOT provided the list of staged files.
    #   Generally, repo-based hooks DO accept user-args.
    #
    # Repo-Hook Suffixes:
    #   *-repo     : Hook runs with no target argument
    #                (good for adding custom arguments / targets)
    #   *-repo-dir : Hook runs using './...' as target.
    #   *-repo-pkg : Hook runs using '$(go list)/...' as target.
    #
    # Fix Suffix:
    #   Hooks named `*-fix` fix (modify) files directly, when possible.
    #
    # Aliases:
    #   Consider adding aliases to longer-named hooks for easier CLI usage.
    #
    # Useful Hook Parameters:
    #   -   id: hook-id
    #       alias: hook-alias       # Create an alias
    #       args: [arg1, arg2, ...] # Pass arguments
    #       always_run: true        # Run even if no matching files staged
